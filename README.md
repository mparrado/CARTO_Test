# CARTO_Test

TEST DE CARTO : https://gist.github.com/jorgesancha/2a8027e5a89a2ea1693d63a45afdd8b6

What follows is a technical test for this job offer at CARTO: https://boards.greenhouse.io/cartodb/jobs/705852#.WSvORxOGPUI

Build the following and make it run as fast as you possibly can using Python 3 (vanilla). The faster it runs, the more you will impress us!

Your code should:

+ Download this ~2GB file: https://s3.amazonaws.com/carto-1000x/data/yellow_tripdata_2016-01.csv
+ Count the lines in the file
+ Calculate the average value of the tip_amount field.

All of that in the most efficient way you can come up with.

That's it. Make it fly!
